'''
This script creates a local file called military_warehouse.db and sets up a table (like a spreadsheet) with strict columns.

What Does the Cursor Actually Do?
The cursor handles two primary jobs:

1. Executing SQL Commands (.execute())
You tell the cursor what SQL statement to run:
cursor.execute("SELECT part_name, price FROM Inventory WHERE price > 50")

2. Fetching and Tracking Rows (.fetchone(), .fetchall())
When the database finds matching rows, the cursor acts like a bookmark pointing at the current row:

cursor.fetchone() - Grabs the next single row and moves the pointer forward by one.

cursor.fetchall() - Grabs all remaining matching rows at once as a list.

cursor.fetchmany(10) - Grabs the next 10 rows (ideal for streaming chunks of data without overloading memory).
